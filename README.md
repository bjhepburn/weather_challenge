# weather_challenge
Weather challenge requests weather data from public APIs for 500 cities of varying distance from the equator. The data is compiled into dataframes, merged and cleaned then analyzed to provide data on how distance from the equator effects weather patterns and attempts to draw a correlation between the two.
